# Changelog

All notable changes to crowdsim are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-05

Adds a test suite and a GUI. Neither changes what a run does: the generator's behaviour is unchanged, the
safety gates still live in `bin/crowdsim`, and the GUI is a form over that same CLI.

### Added
- **Test suite**, four layers, none of which generates load except the last:
  - `tests/unit/` (`node --test`) over the generator logic now extracted into `k6/lib/{mix,classify,summary}.js`:
    mix renormalisation when a class is skipped or dropped, the ramp and the `hold=0s` case, VU
    provisioning sized on rate × timeout, RSC repeat-vs-random, cache classification including
    *absent header ≠ miss*, and the `generator_ok` / `target_unreachable` verdicts.
  - `tests/cli/` (`bats`) over `bin/crowdsim` with a stub k6: both gates, the exit-code contract
    (2 usage · 3 gate · 4 unreachable · 5 k6 missing), profile and target resolution, `@file` pools,
    empty-pool dropping, `--touch-and-go`, history accumulation, and that the brake tripping exits 0.
  - `tests/gui/` (`node --test`) over the API on a real socket: profile-directory traversal attempts, the
    safe-peak confirmation, one-run-at-a-time, refusals passed through with their exit code, no webhook
    in any response.
  - `tests/e2e/` a real ~12 req/s run against an nginx container on loopback, asserting the mix
    proportions, the cache classification, the history row and the GUI reading them back.
  - `make test` (no load), `make test-e2e` (load, local only), `make lint`.
- **GUI** — `crowdsim serve`, a React page served by a small Express API (`gui/`):
  profile editor with live validation, run launcher showing the mix the peak implies and whether the
  target is allowlisted, live log over SSE with a graceful Stop, run archive with a knee plot and a
  comparison against previous runs at the same profile/target/shape.
  - Binds `127.0.0.1` by default and refuses any other address without `CROWDSIM_GUI_TOKEN`.
  - The safe-peak override requires the checkbox *and* the profile name typed for that run; it is never
    stored server-side, and the confirmation is stripped from the run record.
  - One run at a time (409 naming the active run); Stop sends SIGINT so the summary is still written.
  - Reads and writes only the driver's own files: `out/history.tsv`, `out/summary-*.json`, `profiles/`.
- `k6/lib/` as the single home for logic worth testing, imported unchanged by `k6/live-event.js`.

### Changed
- `bin/crowdsim`: new `serve` subcommand and `--port` / `--bind`; `doctor` now also reports node and
  whether the GUI has been built. `--help`, the Nomad job and the Docker image are unaffected.
- `k6/live-event.js` delegates the ramp, the classification and the summary to `k6/lib/`. Behaviour is
  unchanged; `handleSummary` is now a shell that supplies the run context.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-05

First release. Extracted from an internal load-testing harness and generalised: the request-class mix,
URL pools, cache headers, SLOs and safety allowlist are now a **profile** supplied at runtime, so the
tool itself knows nothing about any particular site.

### Added
- `bin/crowdsim` driver: `doctor`, `discover`, `probe`, `load`, `cache-ab`, `history`.
- `k6/live-event.js` generator: profile-driven request classes (`plain`, `rsc`), `mix` and `journey`
  shapes, per-class latency/error/cache metrics, emergency brake with `abortOnFail`, and a
  `generator_ok` validity flag that marks generator-bound runs as unusable.
- Two safety gates: a mandatory target-host allowlist, and `--i-know-this-breaks-production` above the
  profile's safe peak. No interactive confirmation, so the gates also hold on a scheduler.
- `Dockerfile` and `nomad/crowdsim.nomad.hcl` (parameterized batch job) for running the generator on a
  Linux host near the target.
- `cache-ab/`: two-leg reverse-proxy A/B harness with documented nginx templates.
- Documented example profile, README, and cache-ab guide.
